    "\n",
    "🧾 Document Understanding: It takes a reading passage (e.g., from a PDF or transcript) and understands the academic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Question Generation with Structured Output: It generates multiple-choice TOEFL-style questions in JSON format, including distractors, the correct answer, and explanations.\n",

      "D. The properties and distribution of the element iridium.\n",
      "❌ Incorrect. The correct answer was C.\n",
      "Explanation: Option C is correct because the passage primarily discusses different theories explaining the extinction of dinosaurs, evaluating both climatic change and asteroid impact hypotheses.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Question 2: According to the passage, which of the following observations weakens the theory that simple climatic change due to sea-level retreat caused dinosaur extinction?\n",
      "A.  The relatively constant temperature maintained by shallow seas during the Cretaceous.\n",
      "B. The discovery of iridium in a clay layer marking the end of the Cretaceous period.\n",

      "B.  The extensive areas of continents covered by shallow seas during the Cretaceous.\n",
      "C.  The dramatic shift from mild to extreme climates at the end of the Cretaceous period.\n",
      "D.  The presence of an unusually high concentration of iridium in the boundary clay layer.\n",
      "❌ Incorrect. The correct answer was D.\n",

      "Question 1: What is the central theme of the passage regarding the rise of Teotihuacan?\n",
      "A. The primary factor in Teotihuacan's growth was its superior military might that overshadowed neighboring cities.\n",
      "B. Teotihuacan's strategic geographic location and abundant natural resources played a crucial role in its development.\n",
      "C. Religious reforms and the construction of massive religious edifices were the sole reasons for Teotihuacan's expansion.\n",
      "D.  Centralized urban planning and advanced administrative techniques independently led to Teotihuacan's dominance.\n",
      "❌ Incorrect. The correct answer was B.\n",
      "Explanation: Option B is correct because the passage emphasizes the significance of Teotihuacan's geographic location, natural trade route, and obsidian resources as key factors contributing to its rise and prosperity.  These elements are highlighted as fundamental advantages that propelled its development.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Question 2: According to the passage, what event concerning Cuicuilco indirectly facilitated Teotihuacan's ascent as a major power?\n",
      "A.  A successful military invasion of Cuicuilco by Teotihuacan forces.\n",
      "B. A major drought that devastated Cuicuilco's agricultural capabilities.\n",
      "C.  A volcanic eruption that severely damaged Cuicuilco.\n",
      "D.  A shift in religious practices away from Cuicuilco towards Teotihuacan.\n",
      "❌ Incorrect. The correct answer was C.\n",
      "Explanation: Option C is correct because the passage explicitly states that Cuicuilco, the largest center before 200 B.C., was 'seriously affected by a volcanic eruption'. This event 'eliminated' Cuicuilco as a potential rival, allowing Teotihuacan to emerge as the dominant power in the region.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Question 3: Based on the text, in what way did obsidian resources specifically contribute to Teotihuacan's economic and population growth?\n",
      "A. Obsidian was primarily used locally within Teotihuacan for constructing religious monuments, stimulating internal employment.\n",
      "B.  The abundance of obsidian allowed Teotihuacan to develop superior weaponry, leading to military victories and territorial expansion.\n",
      "C.  Obsidian served as a valuable trade commodity, attracting wealth, skilled laborers, and immigrants to Teotihuacan.\n",
      "D.  The artistic carving of obsidian for ornamental purposes generated revenue from elites within Teotihuacan society.\n",
      "❌ Incorrect. The correct answer was C.\n",
      "Explanation: Option C is correct because the passage indicates that the valley was 'rich in obsidian' and that 'long-distance trade in obsidian probably gave the elite residents of Teotihuacán access to a wide variety of exotic goods'. The thriving obsidian operation necessitated more miners, manufacturers, and traders, suggesting that obsidian trade played a significant role in economic growth and attracting population through labor opportunities and wealth creation.\n",

      "D. A comparison of different vocal warm-up routines used by professionals.\n",
      "❌ Incorrect. The correct answer was B.\n",
      "Explanation: Option B is correct because the speaker focuses on both negative speaking habits ('deadly sins') to avoid and positive foundations (HAIL) and vocal techniques (register, timbre, prosody, etc.) to adopt for powerful speaking.\n",
      "------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Question 2: According to the speaker, why do people tend to prefer politicians with lower voices?\n",
      "A. Lower voices are perceived as warmer and more trustworthy.\n",
      "B. Politicians with lower voices tend to use less exaggeration.\n",
      "C. Deeper vocal registers are associated with power and authority.\n",

      "D. A train station\n",
      "❌ Incorrect. The correct answer was B.\n",
